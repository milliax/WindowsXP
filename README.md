# Reviving Windows XP in 2022

## Intro

You must think that I am really crazy to do this.
Surely it is. Because I just failed to pass the personal application today.
So my way to amend my failure is to take a rest and then do my best.
First, I always wanted to build windows XP but I don't really have that chance until I found an ancient activation product key in side my house along with an old laptop.

## Installing Windows XP in VMWare

The most important part is to find the ISO. And I found it easily on wayback machine. Here is the [link](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28windows%20xp%29%20AND%20creator%3A%28Microsoft%29)
Pick one version you like and create a new virtual machine with that ISO.

## Activating Windows XP

After installing it, you would found it is empty even the windows activation service is down. Therefore, you need to activate it via telephone. The whole process is quite straight forward. You just need to listen carefully.

## Accessing the web
I would recommend installing firefox on windows because the last supported version is way newer than chrome for XP. (Though they have all stopped publishing new version for a while) 
Here is the version code and firefox ftp link[firefox 52.9.0esr](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.9.0esr/)
For fear that mozilla might delete the file one day, I saved it on [Github](await for me)

## Windows update

The reason why I wanted to install a pure version of Windows is I am afraid that someone might poison the system. (as XP is so vulnerable)
And, windows update is the most essential function. but the original ie6 is unable to open windows update. Installing IE8 became a big problem since Microsoft had already stopped publishing it.
So I found two download link for two languages:

* English: [source](https://archive.org/details/ie-8-windows-xp-x-86-enu) [backup](wait for me)
